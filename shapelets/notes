Gaussian shapelets code. shapelets_chi.pro makes the polar shapelet (n,m) basis functions. Lines 161-2 are the most interesting,
to set the ellipticity of the gaussian.

Line ~200 then makes the function itself. You probably do want the polars, but you could also use shapelets_phi.pro to
make the cartesian (x,y) gaussian shapelets - it does so a little nicer.

Interestingly, I needed to code my own version of the hermite polynomials, because the built-in IDL/numerical recipes
one was very slow and slightly inaccurate at high n.

Exponential shapelets code. shapelets_psi.pro does very little more than put equation (20) from https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05837 into a language you don't use.  The others plot it or check that various functions are orthogonal - checking that and the sum of all pixels = 1 would be useful unit tests.

We introduce one- and two-dimensional `exponential shapelets': orthonormal
basis functions that efficiently model isolated features in data. They are

In case it's useful, here are my linear algebra routines to decompose an image (class) into shapelet coefficients (class), and vice versa.

Finally, I have lots of functions to evaluate things like the centre of mass of a gaussian shapelet model, or to apply a coordinate transformation such as a shear/rotation/etc. I'll give you those if you need them; first you have to (losslessly) switch the coefficients to a cartesian (x,y) format, and I can show you how to do that too.
