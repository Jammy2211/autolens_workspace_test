SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Light Parametric + Mass Total + Subhalo NFW + Source Parametric Sensitivity Mapping
==================================================================================================================

SLaM pipelines break the analysis down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling a specific aspect of the strong
lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these pipelines has it own inputs which
which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
uses a parametric `Sersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS PIPELINE.

Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, LIGHT LP PIPELINE, MASS PIPELINE and SUBHALO PIPELINE this SLaM script
fits `Imaging` of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

 - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge+disk `Sersic` and `Exponential`.
 - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
 - A dark matter subhalo near The lens galaxy mass is included as a`NFWMCRLudlowSph`.
 - The source galaxy is an `Inversion`.

It ends by performing sensitivity mapping of the data using the above model, so as to determine where in the data
subhalos of a given mass could have been detected if present.

This uses the SLaM pipelines:

 `source_lp`
 `source_pix`
 `light_lp`
 `mass_total`
 `subhalo/detection`

"""
__SOURCE LP PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE (with lens light) uses three searches to initialize a robust model for the 
source galaxy's light, which in this example:
 
 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk with centres aligned for the lens
 galaxy's light.
 
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.

 Settings:

 - Mass Centre: Fix the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the MASS PIPELINE).

"""
__LIGHT LP PIPELINE__

The LIGHT LP PIPELINE uses one search to fit a complex lens light model to a high level of accuracy, using the
lens mass model and source light model fixed to the maximum log likelihood result of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE.
In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Sersic` disk with centres aligned for the lens galaxy's 
 light [Do not use the results of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE to initialize priors].

 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution [fixed from SOURCE LP PIPELINE].

 - Uses the `Sersic` model representing a bulge for the source's light [fixed from SOURCE LP PIPELINE].

 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS 
 PIPELINE [fixed values].

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light)__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (with lens light) uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIPELINE to initialize the model priors and the lens light
model of the LIGHT LP PIPELINE. In this example it:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Sersic` disk with centres aligned for the lens galaxy's 
 light [fixed from LIGHT LP PIPELINE].

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE + centre unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 
 - Uses the `Sersic` model representing a bulge for the source's light [priors initialized from SOURCE 
 PARAMETRIC PIPELINE].
 
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS PIPELINE.

"""
__SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping)__

The SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping) performs sensitivity mapping of the data using the lens model
fitted above, so as to determine where subhalos of what mass could be detected in the data. A full description of
Sensitivity mapping if given in the SLaM pipeline script `slam/subhalo/sensitivity_imaging.py`.

Each model-fit performed by sensitivity mapping creates a new instance of an `Analysis` class, which contains the
data simulated by the `simulate_cls` for that model. This requires us to write a wrapper around the 
PyAutoLens `AnalysisImaging` class.
