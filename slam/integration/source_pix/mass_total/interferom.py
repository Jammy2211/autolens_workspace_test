    SLaM (Source, Light and Mass): Source Light Pixelized + Light Profile + Mass Total + Subhalo NFW
    ================================================================================================

    SLaM pipelines break the analysis down into multiple pipelines which focus on modeling a specific aspect of the strong
    lens, first the Source, then the (lens) Light and finally the Mass. Each of these pipelines has it own inputs which
    which customize the model and analysis in that pipeline.

    The models fitted in earlier pipelines determine the model used in later pipelines. For example, if the SOURCE PIPELINE
    uses a parametric `Sersic` profile for the bulge, this will be used in the subsequent MASS PIPELINE.

    Using a SOURCE LP PIPELINE, LIGHT LP PIPELINE, MASS PIPELINE and SUBHALO PIPELINE this SLaM script
    fits `Imaging` of a strong lens system, where in the final model:

     - The lens galaxy's light is a bulge+disk `Sersic` and `Exponential`.
     - The lens galaxy's total mass distribution is an `Isothermal`.
     - A dark matter subhalo near The lens galaxy mass is included as a`NFWMCRLudlowSph`.
     - The source galaxy is an `Inversion`.

    This uses the SLaM pipelines:

     `source_lp`
     `source_pix`
     `light_lp`
     `mass_total`
     `subhalo/detection`

     - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Exponential` disk with centres aligned for the lens

    """
    __SOURCE PIX PIPELINE 1 (with lens light)__
    
    The SOURCE PIX PIPELINE (with lens light) uses two searches to initialize a robust model for the pixelization
    that reconstructs the source galaxy's light. 
    
    This pixelization adapts its source pixels to the morphology of the source, placing more pixels in its 
    brightest regions. To do this, an "adapt image" is required, which is the lens light subtracted image meaning
    only the lensed source emission is present.
    
    The SOURCE LP Pipeline result is not good enough quality to set up this adapt image (e.g. the source
    may be more complex than a light profile). The first step of the SOURCE PIX PIPELINE therefore fits a new
    model using a pixelization to create this adapt image.
        
    It fits a `Voronoi` pixelization, `Constant` regularization, to set up the model and hyper images, and then:
    
     - Uses a `Voronoi` pixelization.
     - Uses an `AdaptiveBrightness` regularization.
     - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE through to the
     SOURCE PIX PIPELINE.

    The LIGHT LP PIPELINE uses one search to fit a complex lens light model to a high level of accuracy, using the

    In this example it:
    
     - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge and `Sersic` disk with centres aligned for the lens galaxy's 
     light [Do not use the results of the SOURCE LP PIPELINE to initialize priors].

     - Uses an `Inversion` for the source's light [priors fixed from SOURCE PIX PIPELINE].

    model of the LIGHT LP PIPELINE. In this example it:

    __SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection)__
    
    The SUBHALO PIPELINE (single plane detection) consists of the following searches:
     
     1) Refit the lens and source model, to refine the model evidence for comparing to the models fitted which include a 
     subhalo. This uses the same model as fitted in the MASS PIPELINE. 
     2) Performs a grid-search of non-linear searches to attempt to detect a dark matter subhalo. 
     3) If there is a successful detection a final search is performed to refine its parameters.
     
    For this runner the SUBHALO PIPELINE customizes:
    
     - The [number_of_steps x number_of_steps] size of the grid-search, as well as the dimensions it spans in arc-seconds.
     - The `number_of_cores` used for the gridsearch, where `number_of_cores > 1` performs the model-fits in paralle using
     the Python multiprocessing module.
