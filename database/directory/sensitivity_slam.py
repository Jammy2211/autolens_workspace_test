Database: Model-Fit
===================

This is a simple example of a model-fit which we wish to write to the database. This should simply output the
results to the `.sqlite` database file.

"""
__Settings AutoFit__

The settings of autofit, which controls the output paths, parallelization, database use, etc.

    path_prefix=path.join("database", "directory", "sensitivity_slam"),

"""
__Redshifts__

The redshifts of the lens and source galaxies, which are used to perform unit converions of the model and data (e.g. 
from arc-seconds to kiloparsecs, masses to solar masses, etc.).
"""
redshift_lens = 0.5
redshift_source = 1.0

"""
__HYPER SETUP__

The `SetupHyper` determines which hyper-mode features are used during the model-fit as is used identically to the
hyper pipeline examples.

The `SetupHyper` input `hyper_fixed_after_source` fixes the hyper-parameters to the values computed by the hyper 
extension at the end of the SOURCE PIPELINE. By fixing the hyper-parameter values at this point, model comparison 
of different models in the LIGHT PIPELINE and MASS PIPELINE can be performed consistently.
"""
setup_hyper = al.SetupHyper(
    hyper_galaxies_lens=False,
    hyper_galaxies_source=False,
    hyper_image_sky=None,
    hyper_background_noise=None,
)

"""
__SOURCE LP PIPELINE (no lens light)__

The SOURCE LP PIPELINE (no lens light) uses one search to initialize a robust model for the source galaxy's 
light, which in this example:

 - Uses a parametric `Sersic` bulge for the source's light (omitting a disk / envelope).
 - Uses an `Isothermal` model for the lens's total mass distribution with an `ExternalShear`.
 - Fixes the mass profile centre to (0.0, 0.0) (this assumption will be relaxed in the MASS PIPELINE).
"""
analysis = al.AnalysisImaging(dataset=imaging)

source_results = slam.source_lp.run(
    settings_autofit=settings_autofit,
    analysis=analysis,

    lens_bulge=None,
    lens_disk=None,
    mass=af.Model(al.mp.Isothermal),
    shear=af.Model(al.mp.ExternalShear),
    source_bulge=af.Model(al.lp.Sersic),
    redshift_lens=0.5,
    redshift_source=1.0,
)

"""
__MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (no lens light)__

The MASS TOTAL PIPELINE (no lens light) uses one search to fits a complex lens mass model to a high level of accuracy, 
using the lens mass model and source model of the SOURCE PIPELINE to initialize the model priors. In this example it:

 - Uses an `PowerLaw` model for the lens's total mass distribution [The centre if unfixed from (0.0, 0.0)].
 - Carries the lens redshift, source redshift and `ExternalShear` of the SOURCE PIPELINE through to the MASS PIPELINE.
"""

mass_results = slam.mass_total.run(
    settings_autofit=settings_autofit,

    setup_hyper=setup_hyper,
    source_results=source_results,
    light_results=None,
    mass=af.Model(al.mp.PowerLaw),
)

"""
__SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping)__

The SUBHALO PIPELINE (sensitivity mapping) performs sensitivity mapping of the data using the lens model
fitted above, so as to determine where subhalos of what mass could be detected in the data. A full description of
sensitivty mapping if given in the script `sensitivity_mapping.py`.

Each model-fit performed by sensitivity mapping creates a new instance of an `Analysis` class, which contains the
data simulated by the `simulate_function` for that model. This requires us to write a wrapper around the 
PyAutoLens `AnalysisImaging` class.
